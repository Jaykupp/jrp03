          <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
          <p>My absolute favorite food has to be plain ol pepperoni pizza. I enjoy <br />
             other things on my pizza like olives, mushrooms, sausage and things <br />
             like that as well. The taste of pepperoni pizza though is simply <br />
            beautiful to me. I prefer thick crust over thin but in the end pizza is<br />
            pizza.

          <h2>Favorite Planet</h2>

          <p>
            The fifth planet from the sun we call Jupiter is number one on my list. It <br />
             is the biggest planet in our solar system. It is known as a gas giant. <br />
             Jupiter has a big red spot on it that is a constent raging storm. You can<br />
              fit two earths inside of that hole. Jupiter's gravtational strenght is so<br />
               strong that it redirects astroids and other space debris away from<br />
                earth.
          </p>
          <h2>Goal In Life</h2>
          <p>
            My goal in life is to focus on app and web development until I have<br />
             enough experience to create my own apps and make a business out of <br />
             it. I have ideas on making my own social media platform. I would like<br />
              to focus on this the majority of my working life while traveling around<br />
               the world on my free time. My goal for when I retire is to own a few<br />
                beach houses along the coast of California and rent them out to people.<br />
                 I would like to reside in a small beach town like cayucos or shell beach. <br />
